                <h2>MIGUEL NJUGUNA</h2>
                <p>Am a Very Passionate Gamer.I mostly Play On The Weekends and Holidays.I Stream My Progress Through Twitch.
                   I mostly play FIFA And Grand Turismo,and Occasionaly Grand Theft Auto.My First FIFA Game was The 2014,
                   Edition.It's still my Favorite to this Day,Although there are some good classics like the 2015 Edition 
                   and the 2018 Edition.The 2015 Edition mostly because it was the first online gaming edition.The 2018 
                   basically had a new gameplay mode.As for Grand Turismo i just had the feeling for Game Racing and it was
                   the best Game in the market,Which Has Turned Out Better than i imagined.I also do Live Streaming
                   twitch to all my clients to see me in action.I started doing live streaming through Fifa 19 and i have 
                   gradually got into twitch groups and Podcasts talking about the gameplay and Analysing the updates that 
                   happen through out the year.The game is updated severally,especially during transfer windows which happen
                   in January and August.Twitch groups give you constant competition against group members and an idea
                   about your opponents,as you can stream them Live.There is also the question window where you can ask if 
                   in need of an explanation.There are different types of live streaming but Twitch is the best and most
                   used by Modern Gamers.Gaming is improving by the day and quickly becoming One Of the fastest growing 
                   markets in the world.From Game earning competitions to commercial markets.
